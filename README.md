# BodMQTT

Simple publisher/broker combo mainly intended for coordinating ESP32 microcontrollers in my house.

Plan: Go publisher aggregates various API data and publishes to specified topics. Runs alongside the broker for ease.


Future: Abstract configuration to yml/json or something, for easier API->parse->publish workflow config/setup.
